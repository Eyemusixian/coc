<h1> COC easy 3 star any base </h1>
<p><em>Im here to simplify your attacking strategy</em> </p>
<br>
<p>So, to 3 star a base in <strong><a href="https://clashofclans.com/">clash of clans</a></strong>, we need to know certain things before attacking the base. For example : If the opponent have 3 multiple infernos
    and we deploy higly fragile troops like witch and bats... that could messed up the attack, in simple terms clash of clans is like solving
    a cross word puzzle.

<h3>Things to keep in mind</h3>
   <ul>
       <li>Infero tower position & it's settings</li>
       <li>Wizard tower position</li>
       <li>Eagle artillery position</li>
       <li>Air defence position</li>
       <li>Scatter Shot</li>
       <li>Hero position</li> 
   </ul>

<h3>Why we need to focus on these things?</h3> 
   <ol>
       <li>Inferno tower : Inferno towers are the main defences and it is very important to check if it is single or multiple, If it is single
           inferno then we can deploy troops like Bowler, Witch, ballons and other low HP troops. We can also execute a bat attack without using freeze spells
           and if the infernos are set to multiple then we can take the advantage of high HP troops like Dragons, Super witch, PEKKA etc. </li>
       <li>Wizard Tower : The key reason to look out for Wizard Towers is for a deadly bat attack. Wizard tower and multiple infernos can be a real
           threat to the bat attack so keep in mind if the wizard towers are conjusted in an area then we can destroy an area of the base within seconds.</li>
       <li>Eagle Artillery : If we fail to take out ED at the early stage, this giant Badongkadong can be a real threat to our attack because of it's range
           and area of damage.</li>
       <li>Air defence position : We all know what an air defence can do, if we want to plot a drag attack then knowing the positioning of air defence is 
           crucial, we should plan ahead how we can take out those ADs. For eg: heroes can take out or few early 2-3 ballons can but make sure to take it out before
           it hits your main troops.</li>
       <li>Scatter Shot : Scatter Shots are always been a reason why many fail in war, we can distract it by deploying a skeleton or bat spells, freeze it or
           make the troops go invisible entirely. </li>
       <li>Hero position : While we perform an attack of mass Hog Riders or Lava loon, enemy heroes can be a problem since ballons and Lava hound target on the defences
           in this case we can deploy a head hunter along with the troops, zap it out with lightning or take it our with our heroes.</li>
